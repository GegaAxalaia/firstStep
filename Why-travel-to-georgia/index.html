                    <p>The Ancient Great Silk Road caravans used to pass through Georgia along the centuries. They connected east to west and north to south and had significant cultural influence on Georgia. The antique cave town of Uplistsikhe with more than 350 still existing caves was an important trade city lying on the route. It is well preserved and fascinates it’s visitors.</p>

                    <p>One of Georgia’s claim to fame is that this is the land where, according to the latest archaeological evidence, 8000 years ago vine plant was domesticated and wine was made. It’s no wonder that vine and winemaking are deeply entrenched in Georgian psyche, culture and tradition. Making wine in ‘kvevri’ – a clay vessel dug in the ground – is a uniquely Georgian tradition recognised as UNESCO’s Intangible Cultural Heritage. In the last 20 years, there has been a robust revival of viticulture in Georgia and many regions now boast chateaux, big and small, as well as small family-run boutique wineries ready to delight and amaze their guests, be it humble wine lovers or world-famous wine connoisseurs. Gear up your taste buds and get ready for joy and merriment.</p>

And the legendary Kingdom of Colchis was in nowadays West Georgia. The National Museum exhibits the jewelry from those ancient times of the Argonauts. The gold used to produce those exquisite items was mined and elaborated in Georgia.</p>

This is reflected in the number of Georgian sites recognized and protected by UNESCO World Heritage.

                    <p>Georgia’s Christian history goes back to the 1st century AD when the land was visited by the Apostles. It is believed that a Georgian Jew from Mtskheta, Elias, who witnessed Christ’s crucifixion at Golgotha, brought Christ’s robe back and it is buried in Svetitskhoveli Cathedral in Mtskheta, a UNESCO World Heritage site. Georgia became the third country in the world to adopt Christianity in 337AD. Despite ongoing attacks, conquests and destruction by invaders, both Muslim and Christian, you find many beautiful churches and cathedrals with authentic frescos and uniquely Georgian architectural style.</p>

                    <p>Spoken by less than 5 million people worldwide, Georgian language has an ancient literary tradition. Georgian alphabet was created in the 3rd century BC and developed three distinct writing systems, all of which are in use today. This phenomenon has been recognised by UNESCO and included in the list of Intangible Cultural Heritage. Earliest Georgian inscriptions are found in a church near Bethlehem (AD 430) and in Bolnisi Sioni church (AD 495) in the South-Eastern Georgia. Georgian script is considered to be aesthetically beautiful and particularly pleasing to the eye.</p>

                    <p>Be witness to the hovering men and women, unique steps, and dizzying dance moves, that tell stories of war, love, and friendship—your introduction to Georgian dances! Captivated spectators are left breathless watching the stunning performances and call for an encore with thunderous applauses. The magical sensation fills the theater (or: there’s magic in the air), uniting thus, spectators and dancers into participants in this one big celebration. These dances performed today have been enacted for centuries. Georgian folk songs are also incredibly melodic. Stories are narrated through music. As a matter of fact, Georgian polyphonic singing has been proclaimed by UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage. In 1977 “Chakrulo”, a Georgian folk song, was included in the Golden Records sent into space on the Voyager.</p>

                    <p>Have you been to a city where you can find Georgian Orthodox, Armenian Gregorian and Roman Catholic churches, a synagogue, a mosque and a Zoroastrian temple all within a 5 minute walk of each other? Then, you should definitely come to Georgia and visit our capital Tbilisi – a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural, multi-religious city on the crossroads of history, a city neither European nor Asian but a heady blend of both East and West. Tbilisi was founded in the 5th century AD and has attracted visitors ever since, drawn by the hot springs for which the city is named, by the lively atmosphere of it’s cobbled streets and caravanserais, or simply by what Alexandre Dumas called the “strange, fascinating charm” of this “city of legend and romance.”</p>

                    <h1>10. Delicious cuisine</h1>
                    <p>The word is out and Georgian cuisine is starting to gain the world recognition it deserves. The country’s diverse landscape and climate combined with the presence of cultural influences from the West as well as from the East produced culinary tradition which is rich, varied, and unique in it’s own right. When travelling through various regions one encounters distinct flavours and local dishes specific to the area. This human cultural diversity manifested not just in culinary tradition, is still present in Georgia, and is still holding up and resisting steadily advancing cultural homogenisation. There are culinary delights awaiting every palate and taste embellished by locally produced distinct wines.</p>
